							<h2>Why Leave X and Facebook?</h2>
							<p>Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook have become notorious for invasive data collection and algorithmic manipulation. These platforms track your every interaction—likes, shares, clicks—and use this data to build detailed profiles that are sold to advertisers or used for political influence. Worse yet, they’ve been at the center of numerous scandals involving data breaches, misinformation, and unethical practices. Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how the platform allowed third-party apps to harvest data from over 87 million users without consent, fueling political manipulation and misinformation campaigns.<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup> Similarly, X (formerly Twitter) has faced criticism for amplifying hate speech and misinformation, particularly after Elon Musk reduced content moderation and reinstated previously banned accounts.<sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup> Both platforms have also suffered major data breaches, such as Facebook’s 2018 vulnerability that exposed access tokens for 50 million accounts<sup>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</sup> and X’s 2023 leak of 200 million user emails<sup>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</sup>. These incidents highlight the systemic disregard for user privacy and safety on mainstream social media platforms.</p>
							<p>"The current state of most social platforms is that users are trapped while developers are excluded," said Bluesky CEO Jay Graber. "We aim to create a platform that ensures users have the freedom to choose and developers have the liberty to innovate."<sup>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</sup> This openness is crucial from a privacy perspective because it allows developers to create tools and features that prioritize user control and data security. By enabling innovation on its decentralized AT Protocol, Bluesky ensures that no single company dictates how your data is used. Developers can build apps that minimize data collection, enhance anonymity, or offer advanced encryption, giving users more choices to protect their privacy.</p>
							<p>If you’re serious about protecting your digital footprint, it’s time to consider alternatives.</p>

							<div id="why"><h2>Why Bluesky?</h2></div>
							<img alt="Bluesky" src="images/bluesky.png">
							<p>Bluesky is a decentralized social media platform that prioritizes user privacy, transparency, and control. Unlike traditional platforms, Bluesky operates on the AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol), which allows users to own their data and move between platforms seamlessly.</p>

							<ul style="list-style-type:square">
							 <li><b>Decentralized by Design:</b> Bluesky’s decentralized architecture ensures that no single entity controls your data. Unlike traditional platforms like Facebook or X, where all user data is stored and controlled by one company, Bluesky uses a system where information is spread across multiple independent servers. Think of it like a neighborhood of houses instead of one giant skyscraper—each house (server) can manage its own rules and data, but they can still connect and communicate with each other. This means you own your data, and if you don’t like the way one server is run, you can move to another without losing your posts, followers, or identity. "Bluesky enables users to collaborate on verification and moderation by sharing block lists and labels," explains Martin Fowler.<sup>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</sup></li><br>
							 <li><b>No Ads or Tracking:</b> Bluesky doesn’t rely on invasive tracking or targeted advertising. Instead, Bluesky plans to generate revenue through user-centric methods like offering paid subscriptions for premium features such as custom domains and enhanced profile options. It is also developing support for creators by enabling direct monetization tools like tipping and exclusive content subscriptions, with Bluesky taking a small percentage of these transactions. This approach ensures sustainability while respecting user privacy and avoiding exploitative practices. "It’s refreshing to use a platform where I’m not bombarded by ads or manipulated by algorithms," said Paul Tassi of Forbes.<sup>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</sup></li><br>
							 <li><b>User-Curated Algorithms:</b> Unlike other platforms that dictate what you see, Bluesky lets you customize your feed by choosing or creating algorithms tailored to your interests.</li><br>
							 <li><b>Upcoming Flashes Feature:</b> Bluesky will soon introduce Flashes—a short-form video feature designed to rival Instagram Reels and TikTok. Currently in beta testing (as of February 3, 2025) and expected to launch publicly within the next few weeks, Flashes will allow users to post up to four photos or one-minute videos that automatically sync with their Bluesky account. This seamless integration ensures comments and interactions flow across both platforms, creating a unified social experience while maintaining Bluesky’s commitment to privacy and decentralization.</li><br>
							 <li><b>A Healthier Community:</b> With anti-toxicity features like customizable filters and shared moderation tools, Bluesky fosters a positive online environment. Customizable filters allow users to tailor their experience by blocking specific types of content or interactions they find harmful, giving them greater control over what they see and engage with. Shared moderation tools enable communities to collaborate on curating safe spaces by sharing block lists and labels, reducing the spread of harassment or misinformation across the platform. These tools empower users to shape their own social media experience while maintaining Bluesky’s commitment to decentralization and privacy.</li><br>
