							<h2 id="why">Why Use Have I Been Pwned?</h2>
							<p>In today’s digital world, data breaches are alarmingly common. Hackers frequently steal usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information from websites, leaving millions of people exposed to identity theft and fraud. This is where <b>Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)</b> comes in. Created by security expert Troy Hunt, HIBP is a free online tool that allows you to check if your email address has been involved in a data breach.</p>
							<p>"I created HIBP to help people do good things after bad things happen," says Troy Hunt. "It’s about giving people the knowledge they need to secure themselves after their data has been exposed."<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup></p>
							<p>By signing up for HIBP notifications, you can be alerted whenever your information appears in a new breach. This gives you the opportunity to act quickly—changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), or securing your accounts—before hackers can exploit your data.</p>

							<table class="center-div" style="width: 80%;"><tr><td><i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:orange"></i> <strong><span class="orange">Geek Tip:</span></strong> Using HIBP alongside a password manager like <a target=newwindow href="passwords.html">Bitwarden</a> ensures that even if one account is breached, your other accounts remain secure. Always use strong, unique passwords for every account.</td></tr></table>

							<table class="center-div" style="width: 80%;"><tr><td><i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:red"></i> <strong><span class="red">Yogi Tip:</span></strong> Don’t overthink it! Sign up for HIBP notifications so you’ll know if your email is ever part of a breach. Then just make sure you have strong passwords and update them if you get an alert.</td></tr></table>

							<h2 id="how">How to Use It</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a>.</li>
								<li>Enter your email address into the search bar and click "pwned?" HIBP will check its database of breached accounts to see if your information has been exposed.</li>
								<li>If your information has been found in a breach, review the details provided on the site. This includes which service was breached and what types of data were exposed (<i>e.g.,</i> passwords, email addresses).</li>
								<li>Sign up for breach notifications by clicking "Notify Me." This ensures you’ll be alerted if your information appears in future breaches.</li>
								<li>If a breach is detected, take immediate action:
								    <ul style="list-style-type:square; padding-left:50px">
									    <li>Change your password for the affected account(s).</li>
									    <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.</li>
									    <li>If you reuse passwords across multiple accounts (not recommended!), update those as well.</li>
								    </ul>
							    </li>

						     <h2 id="history">History of Have I Been Pwned?</h2>
						     <p>Troy Hunt, an Australian cybersecurity expert and Microsoft Regional Director, launched Have I Been Pwned in December 2013. He created the site as a way to help individuals understand if their personal data had been exposed in known breaches. Over time, it has grown into one of the most trusted resources for tracking data breaches worldwide.</p>
						     <p>"Troy Hunt and Have I Been Pwned bridge the gap between technical jargon and everyday users," writes Threat Picture. "It empowers people to take control of their online security."<sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup></p>
						     <p>The site’s database includes billions of records from major breaches such as Adobe, LinkedIn, and Facebook. As of February 2025, HIBP contains over 12 billion breached accounts. The site also integrates with law enforcement agencies like the FBI to help identify and mitigate large-scale breaches.</p>
