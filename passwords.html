							<h2>Considerations</h2>
							<p>How many online accounts do you have? Ten? Twenty? Fifty? More? Gmail? Amazon? Netflix? Facebook? Do you have a unique password for each one of those accounts? Wondering how secure that password is?  The top five most popular passwords (password, 123456, 12345678, 1234, and qwerty) could be cracked instantly. Go to <a target="_new" href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">How Secure is my Password</a> to see how long it would take a computer to guess yours.</p>
							<p>Here's the thing... cybercriminals have automated tools which are used to crack weak passwords. If that password they crack happens to be the one for your email account, they can then use that access to reset countless others. If you use that same password across multiple accounts, you might as well just hand those criminals the key to your house.</p>
							<p>"Your brain is a very bad password manager. It's incapable of storing more than a couple of genuinely random strings of reasonable length... That leads to compromises."<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup>
							<p><u>Things NOT To Do</u></p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square; padding-left:50px">
							<li> Do not save your passwords in an unprotected text file.</li>
							<li> Do not save your passwords in a browser.</li>
							<li> Do not use weak passwords. That could include common words or phrases, your birth date, car model, or pet's name. Avoid passwords on the <a target="_new" href="https://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords">Most Common Passwords List</a>.</li>
							<li> Do not use password hints.</li>
							<li> Do not duplicate passwords across websites.</li>
							<li> Do not use passwords exposed in a data breach. "This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts."<sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup></li>
							</ul>
							<p>"If your password conforms to a recognisable pattern, there's a good chance it will either be in a password dictionary or guessable based on other known information about you (wife's or kids name, etc.) If it is short or doesn't contain sufficient variations in characters, the number of attempts required to guess it are going to be much lower; you become the low hanging fruit."<sup>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</sup>
							<p><u>Things TO Do</u></p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square; padding-left:50px">
							<li> Do use a password manager. This will securely save your encrypted login credentials for all online accounts. You need merely remember <u>one</u> master password to access all others.</li>
							<li> Do enable <a href="2fa.html">two factor authentication</a>.</li>
							<li> Do ensure that your master password is long (over 10 characters) and complex (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). Do not include common words and ensure it's unique. Your best bet is a passphrase. For example, "I spent the summer of '96 traveling the world!" This could translate to <i>Istso'96ttw!</i> It would take a computer 485 thousand years to crack that password.</li>
							<li> Do use the password generator supplied by your password manager to create a unique, complex password for each of your accounts.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Remember, "The only secure password is the one you can't remember."<sup>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</sup> The National Cyber Security Centre in the UK answers the question "Should I use a password manager?" quite simply: "Yes. Password managers are a good thing."<sup>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</sup>


							<center><table class="tip"><tr><td><strong><i>"Password managers don't need to be perfect, they just need to be better than *not* using them which they unequivocally still are."</i></strong> <sup>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</sup></td></tr></table></center>

							<h2><a name="why"></a>Why LastPass</h2>
							<p>There are a number of great password managers out there, and <u><b>any one is better than none at all</b></u>. We started using LastPass years ago and have been very happy with it, hence why it's being recommended.</p>
							<p>LastPass is free to use. If you want to pay $24 per year you can upgrade to Premium which gives you password sharing and priority tech support. Paying $48 per year will give you access to <a target="_new" href="https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/get-started-with-lastpass-families-lp070001">LastPass Families</a>, which includes unlimited shared folders and simple family member management. We've opted to do Families and everyone's passwords get stored there.</p>
							<p>Other deciding factors:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square; padding-left:50px">
							<li>Strong encryption
							<li>Password Generator
							<li>Username Generator
							<li>Two-Factor Authentication
							<li>Security Challenge/Audit
							<li>Browser Integration
							<li>Mobile Integration
							<li>Emergency Access
							</ul>
							<p>Once installed and setup, it's pretty straight-forward. "When you land on a site and try to login, the password manager will offer to do it for [you] - if it has your account details, that is. If it doesn't yet know your username and password for a particular site, it will capture them as you type them, and then encrypt them and save them for next time."<sup>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</sup></p>

<center><img border="1" height="300" src="images/github1.png"> <img border="1" height="300" src="images/github2.PNG"></center>

							<p>You can even autofill login credentials on your smart devices! "LastPass is now officially included in the Android Oreo Autofill experience as a Google-certified application."<sup>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</sup> And for those with an iPhone running iOS 12 or later, it now "allows LastPass to autofill usernames and passwords within iOS apps. No more copying and pasting required."<sup>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</sup> If you're using an app on a smart device not yet offering these capabilities, you can always open up the LastPass application, search for the relevant account, copy the password, and then paste it into the other app.</p>

							<h2><a name="how"></a>How to Make the Switch</h2>
							<ol style="padding-left:50px">
							<li>Create a new account with <a target="_new" href="https://lastpass.com">LastPass</a>.</li>
							<li><a target="_new" href="https://www.lastpass.com/multifactor-authentication">Set up two factor authentication</a>.</li>
							<li>Install the LastPass application on your smart devices (<a target="_new" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id324613447">iOS</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid&hl=en ">Android</a>) and your browser of choice (<a target="_new" href="https://brave.com/features/">Brave</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://lastpass.com/misc_download2.php?tab=windows&anchor=cr">Chrome</a>  | <a target="_new" href="https://lastpass.com/misc_download2.php?tab=windows&anchor=ff">Firefox</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://lastpass.com/misc_download2.php?tab=windows#windowsieanywhere">Internet Explorer</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/lastpass/9NBLGGH4V7X0">Microsoft Edge</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://lastpass.com/misc_download2.php?tab=windows&anchor=op">Opera</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://lastpass.com/misc_download2.php?tab=windows&anchor=sfjs">Safari</a>).</li>
							<li>You can either set aside some time to add each of your account logins to LastPass, logging in, and resetting the password with a random one supplied by your password manager, or you can add/change them as they are used over time. At a minimum, I would recommend changing your email, financial, and cell phone accounts immediately.</li>
<br/>
<center><img border="1" height="500" src="images/generate.png"></center>

							<li>Delete stored passwords from all browsers previously used (<a target="_new" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606">Chrome</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-and-import">Firefox</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/manage-passwords-internet-explorer-10">Internet Explorer</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-manage-your-saved-passwords-edge-windows-10#remove">Microsoft Edge</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://www.opera.com/help/tutorials/security/password/">Opera</a> | <a target="_new" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/passwords-preferences-sfri40599/mac">Safari</a>) and turn off the ability to save them there.
							<li>Going forward, remember that to access these newly stored login details (and save new ones), you must remain logged into the LastPass application of your browser. Be vigilant!
